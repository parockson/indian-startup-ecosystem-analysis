    "### Objective: \n",
    "The primary objective is to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. This involves understanding the landscape of start-ups in India, their funding patterns, and the key players in the ecosystem (both start-ups and investors).\n",
    "Problem Definition: The problem can be defined as analyzing the funding received by Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021. This involves understanding the trends in funding, identifying the\n",
    "sectors or industries that are attracting the most investment, and recognizing the major investors in the ecosystem.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Data Understanding: \n",
    "The data that will be used for this analysis includes details of the start-ups, the funding amounts they received, and information about the investors. This data will be\n",
    "provided separately for each year from 2018 to 2021 via three different sources.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Plan: \n",
    "The preliminary plan would involve cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns, and possibly building predictive models to\n",
    "forecast future trends in the start-up ecosystem.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Success Criteria: \n",
    "The success of this project could be measured by the team's ability to gain insights that help in making informed decisions about venturing into the Indian start-up ecosystem.\n",
    "This could involve identifying promising sectors, understanding the competitive landscape, and recognizing potential investment opportunities.\n"

    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "1. The overall trend in funding received by Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021 shows a steady increase, reflecting the growing confidence and interest of investors in the Indian start-up ecosystem.\n",
    "2. The year 2021 saw the highest total funding amount, possibly due to increased digitization efforts, government support for entrepreneurship, and the emergence of new technologies and markets.\n",
    "3. Noticeable fluctuations or anomalies in funding amounts across the four years may be attributed to economic factors, regulatory changes, global events, and shifts in investor sentiments towards certain industries or business models.\n",
    "4. The top industries or sectors that attracted the most funding during this period include e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, and edtech, driven by consumer demand, technological advancements, and regulatory reforms.\n",
    "5. Funding patterns differ among various stages of start-ups, with early-stage start-ups often focusing on product development and market validation, while growth-stage start-ups aim to scale operations and capture larger market shares.\n",
    "6. Prominent investors participating in funding Indian start-ups during this period include venture capital firms, corporate investors, and angel investors, with preferences for innovative technologies, disruptive business models, and scalable solutions addressing critical market needs.\n",
    "7. There is a positive correlation between the size of funding rounds and the subsequent success of start-ups, as larger funding rounds provide resources for expansion, product development, and market penetration, increasing the likelihood of achieving growth milestones and generating returns for investors.\n",
    "8. Geographical trends indicate that funded start-ups are concentrated in major metropolitan areas such as Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi-NCR, where access to talent, infrastructure, and networking opportunities influences funding amounts and investor interest.\n",
    "9. A significant percentage of funded start-ups from each year went on to achieve significant growth or exit events, such as acquisitions or IPOs, highlighting the maturity and potential of the Indian start-up ecosystem.\n",
    "10. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the funding landscape for Indian start-ups during these years by accelerating digital transformation, shifting consumer behaviors, and fostering innovation in sectors such as remote work solutions, healthtech, and online education. There may be notable shifts in investment strategies towards resilient business models, technology-enabled solutions, and sectors poised for long-term growth post-pandemic."

    "8. Are there any geographical trends in terms of where the funded start-ups are based, and how does location influence funding amounts?\n",
    "9. What percentage of funded start-ups from each year went on to achieve significant growth or exit events, such as acquisitions or IPOs?\n",
    "10. How does the COVID-19 pandemic impact the funding landscape for Indian start-ups during these years, and are there any notable shifts in investment strategies or focus areas?"
